Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company from a CSV file containing `Date` and `Profit/Losses` columns.

* The Python script calculated each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Formatted the output analysis to appear as:

  ```text

  --------------------------------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Net Total Amount: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

Helped a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process using a CSV set of poll data composed of `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate` columns.

* Created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* Formatted the output analysis to appear as:

  ```text
  Election Results

  Total Votes: 3521001
  -------------------------
  Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
  Correy: 20.000% (704200)
  Li: 14.000% (492940)
